# Ecom_Final_Project
Final Ecommerce project at Vanier

Team members: Dinal Patel, Jiamin Yuan

## StoreFront
We will build a storefront for bricks-and-mortar stores to sell specific products to the buyer.
Our project will support the following stories:

The seller can ...
1. Register, login, and logout (these are not new features - they are given in class).
2. Add and modify products for sale and track sales of these products (3 features).
3. Create and modify store profile (1 feature).
4. View product purchases and mark them as shipped while adding tracking information (2 features).
5. View client service requests on sales and respond (2 features).

The user can ...
1. Search the product catalog (1 feature).
2. See product details (1 feature).
3. Add/delete/modify quantities for products in the shopping cart (3 features).
4. Checkout and pay for order (1 feature).
... This is 8 features per team member

We will model our solution based on the Uniqlo online store. We estimate that we
will spend a total of 120 hours building this product, i.e., 60 hours per team member.
